TODO #3: Create GET /api/version endpoint (server/index.js) - Medium

FILE: server/index.js
LOCATION: After /health route, before "// ===== CAPABILITIES ====="

ANSWER - Add this route:
  app.get('/api/version', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
      version: '1.0.0',
      name: 'IsoTown',
      author: 'Your Name',
      description: 'Pixel city builder with real-world APIs'
    });
  });

VERIFY: Restart server → GET http://localhost:5176/api/version → see JSON response
