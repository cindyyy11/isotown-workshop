#1: Add console.log for debugging (weatherService.js) - Easy

FILE: src/services/weatherService.js
LOCATION: Inside fetchWeather(), in the "if (cached)" block (around line 111)

ANSWER - Add this line:
  console.log('✅ Using cached weather data:', cached);

FULL BLOCK (after):
  if (cached) {
    console.log('✅ Using cached weather data:', cached);
    return cached;
  }

VERIFY: Change location twice within 5 min → open Console → see "✅ Using cached weather data"

See "#1 checkpoint.md" for full details and teaching notes.
