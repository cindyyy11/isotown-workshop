TODO #2: Add console.log for fresh fetch (weatherService.js) - Easy

FILE: src/services/weatherService.js
LOCATION: In fetchWeather(), right before the "try {" that calls the API (around line 124)

ANSWER - Add this line:
  console.log('🌐 Fetching fresh weather from server...', { lat, lon });

VERIFY: Change location → open Console → see "🌐 Fetching fresh weather..." and a request in Network tab

See "#2 checkpoint.md" for full details and teaching notes.
